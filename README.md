# TFE4152-8x8-bit-memory-IC
This is a design and implementation of a 8x8-bit memory module for the course project in TFE4152 Design of Integrated Circuits. It includes designing a 1-bit bitcell with custom transistor specifications, and simulating it with AIM-Spice (SPICE simulation software) using the 90nm gpdk process parameters with power consumption in mind. Then making the combined module in SystemVerilog and writing test benches to test the functionality of the whole system
